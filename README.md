# 📌Key Features :

EenTrack is an app, in which creating a meeting is as easy as just pressing a button and joining is as easy as scanning a QR along with the details of attendees and meeting. Being a college student we are enrolled in a lot of communities. We do a lot of community meetings as well. One problem that comes up again and again is regarding attendance. We need to take the attendance of attendees to give it to college, to compensate for their college attendance, and it also helps to keep track of activeness of the members. But attendance is not taken. We asked ourselves why is that? The answer is simple, taking attendance is lot of hasel. so we set out to solve that.
