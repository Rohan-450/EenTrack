# 🤩About The Project :



# 💭Inspiration :
- Being a college student we are enrolled in a lot of communities. We do a lot of community meetings as well. One problem that comes up again and again is regarding attendance. We need to take the attendance of attendees to give it to college, to compensate for their college attendance, and it also helps to keep track of activeness of the members. But attendance is not taken.
- To solve this problem , we came up with a solution using **Cross Platform Framework Flutter**. 
-  <H4>Usecase : Physical Ledger</H4> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Point 1


-  <H4>Another Usecase : Custom attendace systems for large meetings</H4>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Point 2


# 💡What problem does the project solve?
- The project aims to solve the problem of **Attendance Tracking** in small and medium community meetings.
- 


# 📌 Usage :

### Register phase:
1. Users will register using email and password.
2. Data of students like name, roll, sem, phone, GitHub profile (optional), LinkedIn profile (optional)
3. Once logged in, either you can join a meeting or create a meeting.

### Create meeting:
1. Once logged in, go to create meetings tab
2. There you will see your past meetings if you have any
3. Tap on create meeting
4. You will be navigated to a screen where you'll see a QR code, using which attendee will mark their attendance.
5. Below the QR code you'll get the list of attendees who scanned the QR
6. Once all the attendance is taken, press the export button to export the details of attendees in Excel sheet

### Join a meeting:
1. Click the scan QR button
2. Scan the QR code of a meeting
3. Your attendance is recorded on that meeting

# 💀 Challenges we ran into:
  - Creating the best UI which is logical as well as simple and easy to use was a challenge
  - To convert the design file into responsive flutter code was a big challenge
  - Managing auth state was a big issue that we solved using block
  - Figuring out the best database model to store the user data was a big challenge
  - Managing a team of developer to push their code in a single repo and work together was a big challenge in itself

 
# 🔮 What's Next For Our Project:
- Making the attendace tracking system in a more organised way by enabling the two QR based Attendance Tracker during entry and exit
- Identity Validation of the attendee who is joining the meeting by maintaining a proper database
- Large Screen Optimization and minor bug fixes
